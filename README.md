# üë®‚Äçüíª Buddhika Herath

I am a seasonal Full-stack developer. Started my career in 2015 as a junior front-end developer. Worked on couple of software development firms for 3 years. Then I resigned and started with full-time freelancing ( Had this feeling: "I can do more!" ). Had many ups and downs. Co-founded and founded two startups in tech service sector. Tackled really great innovative projects as a developer and a project cordinator. Got introduced to many new tech stacks. Honed vast array of skill set addition full-stack development. Worked with really nice people. However, this etnreprenuaral journey lasted in 4-5 years ( I don't want to talk about it. I really don't ). Then some gurdian angel (one of my previous client) hired me for the company he worked for. It was a one year contract. Right now, I am waiting for the next employment. Meanwhile learning, coding, writing, .... that's my story! Thank you very much for reading, hope you find something interesting in my public repos ;)
